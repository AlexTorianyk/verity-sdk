# Getting Started with the Verity SDK for NodeJs

### Previous Step

[Stand Up an Evaluation Verity Application](../../../README.md#cloud)

---

This procedure shows you how to set up your NodeJs development environment to use the Verity SDK. As desired, 
run the example application to see a demonstration of how the interactions take place. 

**Prerequisites**

Install the following items:
* `libindy` -- Install a stable version. Follow the instructions on the 
[indy-sdk Github Project Page](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#installing-the-sdk).
* `Ngrok` -- This is a temporary installation to facilitate early experimentation. 
Follow the instructions on the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).
* `NodeJs` -- Follow the instructions on the [NodeJs website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

> **NOTE:** Verify that you have read access to the Public NPM repo.

## Build the NodeJs Verity SDK
Go to the directory where you extracted the tarball.

1. Go to the NodeJs Verity SDK project folder:
  
   ```sh
   cd verity-sdk/sdk/nodejs-sdk
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
## Run the Application

1. **Start `Ngrok`**

   `Ngrok` allows the Verity server instance to reach a webhook endpoint that the example application starts. 
   By default, the example application uses port `4000`, so Ngrok must be started to proxy to that local port:
   
   ```sh
   ngrok http 4000
   ```
   
   `Ngrok` should be running at the same time as the example application, and the endpoint should be given 
   to the example during the *Setup* interaction.

2. **Set up Connect.Me**

   The interaction that is simulated in the example application requires the Connect.Me mobile app. 

   * Find Connect.Me in the Apple and Android app stores. 

   * Follow the [Connect.Me Setup Instructions](../ConnectMe.md)
   
3. **Launch the example application**
   
   Start the example application and begin the simulated interaction:
   
   ```sh
   node example.js
   ```
