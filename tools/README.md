# Verity SDK Tools

To run the scripts in this directory, you should probably create a virtual environment

```
python3.6 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

And install the needed dependencies (inside the activated virtual environment)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run any of the scripts (inside the activated virtual environment) with

```
python provision_sdk.py
# OR
python <name of another script>.py
```
