# Getting Started with the Verity SDK

## What is the Verity SDK?

The goal of the Verity SDK is to provide easy application integration with the Verity server. This integration provides the basis for SSI-enabled workflows such as creating connections, issuing credentials, requesting proof, and general pairwise interactions. The SDK uses `libindy` and Agent-to-Agent protocols to securely authenticate and communicate with the Verity server. With the creation of language-specific bindings, developers can quickly integrate their backend services into the world of SSI with minimal overhead.
