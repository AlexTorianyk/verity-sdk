# Sample Out-of-Band app

This application demonstrates how the Out-of-Band protocol can be used to simplify credential issuance or proof exchange interactions.

When issuing a credential the credential offer can be attached to the Out-of-Band invitation.
When requesting a proof the proof request can be attached to the Out-of-Band invitation.
This allows to eliminate some interactions required from the Holder.

> NOTE: When there is a credential offer or a proof request attached to the invitation, the ConnectMe app will implicitly accept the connection (connection acceptance screen will not be shown in the UI) and will then present the credential offer or proof request from the attachment.

> NOTE: Improved UX comes at the expense of privacy. In the case of credential offer, the inviteURL encoded in the QR code will contain base58 encoded values of credential attributes (PII data). In the case of proof request, the inviteURL will contain requested attributes names in the QR code (no PII is present in the QR code in this case)


## Launching Out-of-Band app using Docker

Prepared `Dockerfile` will setup a complete environment for running this sample application. This is the quickest way to try the application and avoid some complexity around `ngrok` and `libindy` when working on Windows/MacOS.

### Prerequisites
* `docker` is required for this path and installation instructions can be found at [Get Docker Page](https://www.docker.com/get-docker/). 

### Steps:
1. Build docker image. Run the following command from the root of verity-sdk repo:

   ```sh
   docker build -f samples/sdk/Dockerfile -t out-of-band-app .
   ```
2. Start built docker image. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 4000:4000 -it out-of-band-app
   ```

   > **NOTE:** The container will start the Ngrok process in the docker entrypoint. The ngrok processes allows for a public addressable endpoint for the webhook that receives messages from Verity Application. While this is very useful, ngrok does times out after **8 hours**. To reset ngrok, simple re-run the `entrypoint.sh` script that was run when entering the docker container. It is located at `/scripts/entrypoint.sh`. It will kill the existing (and timed out) ngrok processes and start new ones. At which point you are go for another 8 hours.
 
    Launch the Out-of-band sample application. Run the following commands in the started docker container:
    ```sh
    cd /samples/sdk/nodejs-outofband-app
    node out-of-band.js
    ```

    When the application is started for the first time it will provision one Issuer agent and one Verifier agent and will update their webhook endpoints to use the created Ngrok tunnel. It will also perform all necessary steps required for credential issuance (setup Issuer keys, register Issuer DID/Verkey on the ledger, create schema and credential definition). 
    During first-time setup, the application will prompt user for some inputs (e.g. provide provisioning token, answer y/n to some questions)
    The application will persist issuer context, verifier context and credential definition in the files inside the application folder.

    If the application is re-run it will use contexts persisted in the local files instead of provisioning from scratch.

    The application will print all messages received from VAS on the console output of the docker container.

    When the line
    ```
    Listening on port 4000
    ```
    is printed on the console output, the application is provisioned and ready. 
    
    Visit the address http://localhost:4000 from the browser of your host machine to try out the app.
   

## Launching the Out-of-Band application locally

The Out-of-Band application can be launched from a local development environment. Using this local environment, one can try the verity-sdk in a similar environment that a developer developing with verity-sdk would use. This path requires a few more steps, but these steps would be required to build an application with verity-sdk.

### Prerequisites
* `libindy` -- Install a stable version. Follow the instructions on the 
[indy-sdk Github Project Page](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#installing-the-sdk).
* `Ngrok` -- This is a temporary installation to facilitate early experimentation. 
Follow the instructions on the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).

### Build

Build the Out-of-band app with:
```sh
cd /samples/sdk/nodejs-outofband-app
npm install
``` 

### Launch the Out-of-band Application
1. **Start `ngrok`**

   The Verity server instance is not running in the same local environment as the example application. The Verity server instance communicates with the SDK via a webhook. This webhook must be accessible by the Verity server instance, but the example application can only start a local webhook endpoint. `ngrok` is used to provide a publicly available endpoint that tunnels to the local webhook endpoint that is started by the Example App. 
   
   See [Ngrok's product page](https://ngrok.com/product) for a more detailed description of what Ngrok is and what it does. 
   
   The example application uses port `4000` by default for the webhook endpoint. So, `ngrok` much be launched pointing to `4000`.
   
   Start `ngrok` command in a separate terminal with
   ```sh
   ngrok http 4000
   ```
   
   After starting, `ngrok` should provide output that looks like this:
   ```sh
   ngrok by @inconshreveable
                                                                             
   Session Status                online
   Session Expires               6 hours, 11 minutes
   Version                       2.3.35
   Region                        United States (us)
   Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
   Forwarding                    http://a74616ad.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:9003
   Forwarding                    https://a74616ad.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:9003 
   ```
   
   The `Forwarding` URL is what must be given to the Out-of-band application during the initial provisioning. For the above output, it would be `https://a74616ad.ngrok.io` but every time `ngrok` is started a new URL will be generated, but it will have the following format:
   
   `https://<id>.ngrok.io`
   
   > **NOTE:** `ngrok` must be left running during the whole time the example application is running.
1. **Start application**
    Start the application with
    ```sh
    cd /samples/sdk/nodejs-outofband-app
    node out-of-band.js
    ```

    The example application should start and perform several provisioning steps.
    After successful provisioning the application will print the output
    ```
    Listening on port 4000
    ```

   At this point, the application is running and ready.
   Visit the address http://localhost:4000 to try out the app.
