# Getting Started with the Verity SDK for Python
## Standing Up a Evaluation Verity Application
See: [Standing Up a Evaluation Verity Application](../VerityInstance.md)

## Running the Python Example App
The Python Example App is a simple showcase of the Python Verity-SDK.

### Prerequisites

#### Install Libindy
See and follow instructions on [Indy-sdk Github Project page](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#installing-the-sdk).

#### Install Ngrok
See and follow instructions on the [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).

#### Install Python3
See and follow instructions on the [Python3 website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Clone Verity Sdk Repo

```git clone git@gitlab.corp.evernym.com:dev/verity/verity-sdk.git```

#### Repo Requirements:
1. Public PyPi repo

### Build Python Verity SDK
##### Steps:
1. Move the Python Verity SDK project folder
  
   `cd verity-sdk/sdk/python-sdk`
2. Install dependencies

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
### Run
#### Steps:
1. **Start Ngrok**

   Ngrok is used allow the verity application to reach a webhook endpoint that the Example app starts. Be default, the Example App uses port `4000`. So, Ngrok must be started to proxy to that local port. 

   To start `ngrok` use the following command:
   
   ```ngrok http 4000```
   
   This will start `ngrok`, this process will need to be running at the same time as the Example App and endpoint will need to later be given to the Example App. 
   
   See the *Setup* interaction below.
1. **Get and Setup Connect.Me**

   The interaction that is simulated in the Example App requires the use of the Connect.me mobile app. 
   
   The Connect.me mobile app can be found on the Apple App Store and Android App Store.
   
   See: [Connect.Me Setup Instruction](../ConnectMe.md)

   
1. **Launch Example App**
   
   `python3 example.py`
   
   will start the Example App and begin the simulated interaction.

#### Interactions
The Example App guides the User through a series of interactions as explain below:

1. **Setup**
   
   During setup there are three task being accomplished:
   
   1. Provisioning an Agent
   1. Registering a Webhook
   1. Setting up an Issuer Identity 
   
   When setting up for the frist time, the Example app will require to inputs from the using during this process. These inputs will be asked for by the Example app.
   1. The url for the Verity Application it will be connecting to.
   2. The ngrok url for the webhook that was started earlier. 
   
   Additionally, the Issuer Identity must be written to the ledger. This can be done using the [Sovrin Self-Serve website](https://selfserve.sovrin.org/) for the Sovrin StagingNet. The DID and Verkey will be displayed in the console and they must be transferred accurately to the self-serve site. The Example app will pause and will for this state to be completed. Press enter once the identity is on the ledger.
   
   After the first setup, the context for the verity-sdk is saved to disk and can be reused. 
1. **Connecting**
   
   Connecting is largely automated in the Example App. Incoming messages can be view in the console as they arrive from the Verity Application.
    
   A `QR code` image will be generated and place in the current working directory. This QR code can be scanned by the Connect.me app to finish forming the connection between Verity Application and Connect.me.<!--1. Ask a Committed Answer-->
1. **Write Schema to Ledger**

   Writing the Schema to the Ledger is fully automated in the Example App. Incoming messages can be view in the console as they arrive from the Verity Application.
1. **Write Credential Definition to Ledger**

   Writing the Credential Definition to the Ledger is fully automated in the Example App. Incoming messages can be view in the console as they arrive from the Verity Application.
1. **Issue Degree Credential**
   
   Issuing a credential is automated in the Example App. It will wait for steps to be completed in the Connect.me App asynchronously. The credential should pop up in the Connect.me App and in the Connect.me app it can be accepted.
1. **Request Proof Presentation**
   The request for Proof is automated in the Example App. It will wait for steps to be completed in the Connect.me App asynchronously. The request should pop up in the Connect.me App and in the Connect.me app it can be accepted.
   
After the proof is exchange with the Verity Application, the simulated interaction will be complete and the Example App will terminate.
