# Interactions

### Previous Step

Language-specific setup:
* [Java](/docs/Getting-Started/java/README.md)
* [NodeJs](/docs/Getting-Started/nodejs/README.md)
* [Python](/docs/Getting-Started/python/README.md)

After you launch the example application in the previous step, the example process completes 
a series of interactions:

1. **Setup**
   
   During setup, three tasks are being accomplished:
   
   1. Provisioning an Agent

   2. Registering a webhook

   3. Setting up an Issuer identity 
   
   When setting up for the first time, the example application will require these inputs from the user:

   * The URL for the Verity server instance that it will be connecting to
   
   * The `Ngrok` URL for the webhook that you started earlier
   
   Additionally, the issuer identity must be written to the ledger, using the
    [Sovrin Self-Serve Website](https://selfserve.sovrin.org/) for the Sovrin StagingNet. 
    The DID and Verkey will be displayed in the console, and they must be transferred accurately 
    to the self-serve site. The example application will pause and wait for this state to be 
    completed. Press **Enter** as soon as the identity is on the ledger.
   
   After initial setup, the context for the Verity SDK is saved to disk and can be reused. 

1. **Connect**
   
   Connecting is largely automated in the example application. You can view incoming messages 
   in the console as they arrive from the Verity server instance.
    
   A QR code image will be generated and placed in the current working directory. Scan this QR
   code with Connect.Me to finish forming the connection between the Verity server instance 
   and Connect.Me.

2. **Write Schema to Ledger**

   Writing the schema to the ledger is fully automated in the example application. You can view 
   incoming messages in the console as they arrive from the Verity server instance.

3. **Write Credential Definition to Ledger**

   Writing the credential definition to the ledger is fully automated in the example application. 
   You can view incoming messages in the console as they arrive from the Verity server instance.

3. **Issue Degree Credential**
   
   Issuing a credential is automated in the example application. It will wait for steps to be 
   completed in Connect.Me asynchronously. Accept the credential in Connect.Me when it pops up.

4. **Request Proof Presentation**

   The request for proof is automated in the example application. It will wait for steps to be 
   completed in Connect.Me asynchronously. Accept the proof in Connect.Me when it pops up.
   
After the proof is exchanged with the Verity server instance, the simulated interaction is complete 
and the example application terminates.
